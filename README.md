# Discount Calculator

This is a simple Python program that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount.  
The program only applies the discount if it is **20% or more**; otherwise, it returns the original price.

## Features
- Takes user input for the original price and discount percentage.
- Applies discount only if it is 20% or higher.
- Returns either the discounted price or the original price.
- Includes a well-documented function `calculate_discount()`.

## How It Works
1. The user is prompted to enter:
   - The original price of the item.
   - The discount percentage.
2. The program checks if the discount percentage is 20% or higher.
3. If the condition is met:
   - The discount is applied.
   - The final price is displayed.
4. If the condition is not met:
   - No discount is applied.
   - The original price is displayed.

## Example Usage
Enter the original price of the item: 100
Enter the discount percentage: 10
No discount applied. Price remains: 100.0
